	name: 'CAGE THE ELEPHANT',
	image: 'assets/images/cage.jpg',
	bio: "Although chart success in England was an unlikely first step to fame for a band from Bowling Green, Kentucky, mainstream rock band Cage the Elephant achieved just that. Formed by Matt Shultz, Brad Shultz, Jared Champion, Lincoln Parish, and Daniel Tichenor, the group earned a contract with the Relentless label and released the Free Love single late in 2007. A support slot for the Pigeon Detectives beckoned in early 2008, and follow-up single 'Ain't No Rest for the Wicked' reached the Top 40 in June. The group's self-titled debut followed soon after, becoming a respectable commercial and critical success. Two years later they returned with the single 'Shake Me Down', while early 2011 saw the release of their second album, Thank You Happy Birthday. In early 2012, the band released the live CD and DVD Live from the Vic in Chicago, which captured performances from their sold-out two-night run at the famous Chicago venue. Returning to the studio, the band recorded its third album, Melophobia. Released in October 2013, the album saw the group collaborating with Alison Mosshart (the Kills, the Dead Weather) and featured the modern rock radio hit Come a Little Closer. During the Melophobia era, the band parted ways with their founding guitarist, Lincoln Parish, who went on to focus on producing for other artists in Nashville. In late 2015, the band released their fourth album, Tell Me I'm Pretty, which was produced by Dan Auerbach of one-time tourmates the Black Keys. ~ Chris True, Rovi"

	name: 'WILLIE NELSON',
	image: 'assets/images/willie.jpeg',
	bio: "This versatile, eclectic, rather wanderlust country crossover star known for his classic ballads ('Always On My Mind'), autobiographical road songs ('On the Road Again') and catchy rhythms ('Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys') started out life as Willie Hugh Nelson on April 30, 1933, in Depression-era Abbot, Texas. He is the son of Myrle Marie (Greenhaw) and Ira Doyle Nelson, a mechanic. After his mother abandoned the family and his father died, he and sister Bobbie Lee were raised by their gospel-singing grandparents. Working in the cotton fields, Willie was handed his first guitar at age six and within a short time was writing woeful country songs and playing in polka bands. During his teenage years he played at high school dances and honky-tonks. He also worked for a local radio station and by graduation time he had become a DJ with his own radio show. Briefly serving a stint with the Air Force (discharged because of a bad back, which would plague him throughout his life), he sold his first song called 'No Place For Me' while getting by with menial jobs as a janitor and door-to-door Bible salesman. Married in 1952 to a full-blooded Cherokee, he and first wife Martha had two children. He initially came to be known in Nashville for selling his songs to well-established country artists such as Patsy Cline ('Crazy'), Faron Young ('Hello Walls') and Ray Price ('Night Life'). In 1962 he recorded a successful duet with singer Shirley Collie, whom he would later take as his second wife, but his career didn't progress despite joining the Grand 'Ol Opry. In the early 1970s, after extensive touring with his band (which included sister Bobbie on the piano) and experiencing a number of career downswings, he started performing and recording his own songs instead of selling them to others. Two of his albums, 'Shotgun Willie' and 'Phases and Stages', helped him gain some stature. In 1975 it all came together with the album 'Red-Headed Stranger', which would become the top-selling country music album in history and propel him into the country music stratosphere. His offbeat phrasing, distinctive nasal tones and leathery, bewhiskered hippie-styled looks set a new standard for 'outlaw' country music. Around 1978 Willie showed himself to be a loose and natural presence in front of the camera, thus launching a film career. He had roles in several movies, his first opposite Robert Redford and Jane Fonda in The Electric Horseman (1979). His took to leading roles as a country music star in Honeysuckle Rose (1980), which would include a number of his songs on the soundtrack. He played opposite James Caan and Tuesday Weld in Thief (1981) and a legendary outlaw in the western Barbarosa (1982). In the movie Red Headed Stranger (1986), which was adapted from his hit 1975 album, he played a preacher, and he teamed up with pal Kris Kristofferson as a pair of country singers in Songwriter (1984).  He and pal Kristofferson went on to form The Highwaymen with the late Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings and he successfully recorded and toured with the group for a number of years. They also teamed up to remake the classic western Stagecoach (1939) as a TV movie (Stagecoach (1986)). As a unique song stylist, the bearded, braided-haired, bandanna-wearing non-conformist took a number of non-country standards and made them his own, including Elvis Presley's 'You Were Always on My Mind' and Ray Charles' 'Georgia on My Mind'. He happily married fourth wife Ann-Marie in 1991 and has survived more hard times in recent years, including a $16.7-million debt to the IRS and the suicide of one of his sons, Billy. Inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1993, Nelson received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1998."

	name: 'NOTHING BUT THIEVES',
	image: 'assets/images/nbt.jpeg',
	bio: "Hailing from Southend-on-Sea in Essex, England, Nothing But Thieves make passionate guitar-based rock that balances indie rock artfulness with a pop sensibility. Formed in 2012, Nothing But Thieves feature singer Conor Mason, guitarist Joe Langridge-Brown, guitarist Dominic Craik, bassist Philip Blake, and drummer James Price. The group gained early attention with several EPs, including 2013's If You Don't Believe, It Can't Hurt You and 2014's Graveyard Whistling. In 2015, Nothing But Thieves released their self-titled debut album, featuring the singles 'Itch,' 'Hanging,'' and 'Trip Switch,'' with the latter reaching number one on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. Nothing But Thieves would eventually break into the Top 15 of the Billboard Alternative, Heatseekers, and Rock Album charts."

	name: 'KENDRICK LAMAR',
	image: 'assets/images/kendrick.jpeg',
	bio: "Platinum-selling, Grammy-nominated rapper Kendrick Lamar is one of the rare artists who has achieved critical and commercial success while earning the respect and support of those who inspired him. A native of Compton, California, Lamar originally rapped as K. Dot and released a series of mixtapes under that name. Youngest Head Nigga in Charge (2003), issued when he was only 16 years old, caught the attention of Top Dawg Entertainment and led to a long-term association that helped raise the rapper's profile. Training Day (2005) and C4 (2009) also preceded his decision to go by his birth name. The latter was issued the same year he became part of Black Hippy -- beside fellow Top Dawg artists Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, and ScHoolboy Q -- a group whose members, for the most part, appeared on one another's mixtapes and albums. Overly Dedicated (2010) was the first Kendrick Lamar mixtape and fared well enough to enter Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart that October. His first official album, Section.80 (2011), was released as a digital download the following year and entered the Billboard 200 at number 113. By that point in his career, Lamar's reputation had been strengthened through guest appearances on dozens of tracks, and he had the support of veteran West Coast stars as well. During a 2011 concert, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Game dubbed him 'The New King of the West Coast,' a notion Dre endorsed more significantly by signing Lamar to the Aftermath label. Lamar's Good Kid, M.A.A.D City was released in October 2012 and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. Three of its singles -- 'Swimming Pools (Drank),' 'Poetic Justice,' and 'Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe' -- reached the Top Ten of Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart, with each one enjoying lengthy stays on playlists of urban U.S. radio stations. More significantly, the album showcased Lamar as an exceptional storyteller capable of making compelling concept albums. When the nominees for the 56th Annual Grammy Awards were announced, Lamar was listed in seven categories, including Best New Artist and Album of the Year. He won none of the awards. Rather than rest, Lamar remained active during 2013-2014, with touring as well as appearances on tracks by the likes of Tame Impala, YG, and fellow Top Dawg affiliate SZA. Early in 2015, he announced that his third album, To Pimp a Butterfly, was due in March with tracks featuring Snoop Dogg, Bilal, Thundercat, and George Clinton. A technical accident caused the digital album to be released eight days early, but it immediately earned rave reviews and topped the Billboard 200 with sales of 325,000 copies within its first week. It made numerous best-of lists at the end of the year, and earned five Grammy Awards in early 2016. In March, Lamar released untitled unmastered., an eight-track album consisting of demos he'd recorded around the time of To Pimp a Butterfly. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi"

	name: 'TWO DOOR CINEMA CLUB',
	image: 'assets/images/club.jpeg',
	bio: "Mixing electronic polish with guitar-driven hooks à la Phoenix and the Postal Service, Bangor and Donaghadee, Northern Ireland's Two Door Cinema Club feature singer/guitarist/programmer Alex Trimble, guitarist/singer Sam Halliday, and bassist/singer Kevin Baird. Trimble and Halliday met in school, and met Baird through mutual friends. The trio began playing as Two Door Cinema Club in 2007 and skipped going to university to focus on the band. Fortunately, the gamble paid off -- the band's debut EP, Four Words to Stand On, was released in January 2009 by the hip French label Kitsuné to positive reviews and music blog buzz, which grew with the release of April's single 'Something Good Can Work.' That summer, Two Door Cinema Club recorded their debut album in London's Eastcote Studios with Eliot James, which they mixed with producer Philippe Zdar in Paris that fall. The group's remixes of Phoenix's 'Lasso' and Chew Lips' 'Salt Air' also appeared that year, and by 2009's end, the group was among the acts featured in the BBC Sound of 2010 Poll. Another single, 'Undercover Martyn,' arrived in January 2010, shortly before the band's first full-length Tourist History was released. In 2012, Two Door Cinema Club returned with its sophomore album, the Jacknife Lee-produced Beacon. Generally well-received, the album hit the number one spot on the Irish album charts, and number two in the United Kingdom. It featured the two singles 'Sleep Alone' and 'Sun,' and preceded a short documentary about the band, entitledWhat We See, which followed the trio as they undertook a tour in the summer of 2012. It would be a wait of four years before the band's third effort would materialize. Arriving in summer 2016, Gameshow featured the lead single 'Are We Ready? (Wreck)' and the band undertook a string of high-profile festival appearances -- including Glastonbury -- to promote the new release. ~ Heather Phares, Rovi'"

	name: 'THE STRUTS',
	image: 'assets/images/struts.jpeg',
	bio: "Akin to the Darkness in their unabashedly over the top, retro-fetishist, classic rock style, English rockers the Struts burst onto an unsuspecting public with big dreams and loud mouths to match. The band was the brainchild of singer Luke Spiller, the child of strict Christian parents, who had dreamed of being a showman ever since becoming obsessed with Michael Jackson at the age of seven. With his sexualized swagger, powerful voice, and outrageous pronouncements like 'I was born to do this, and I'll die doing it,' Spiller came off like a cross between Freddie Mercury, David Bowie, Mick Jagger, andRobert Plant. The band's music was a similar blend of '60s and '70s tropes, with big, singalong choruses that earned their videos hundreds of thousands of YouTube hits and won them a deal with Mercury Records. Born and raised in Bristol before moving with his parents to Devon, Spiller practiced his moves for years in his bedroom before deciding the time was right to form a band. He recruited guitarist Adam Slack, bassist Jed Elliott, and drummer Gethin Davies, and they all lived and rehearsed together in Derby for two years, steadily building a reputation through solid gigging. Eventually, the band got the attention of Mercury, who signed them. Their career was boosted whenSpiller was recruited by Mike Oldfield to do all the vocals for his 2014 album Man on the Rocks; they were then invited to support Black Sabbath at their massive Hyde Park gig, winning over a hostile crowd. Their debut album, Everybody Wants, was released in July 2014, peaking at number 52 on the U.K. albums chart. The following year saw the release of the EP Have You Heard."

	name: 'RADIOHEAD',
	image: 'assets/images/radiohead.jpeg',
	bio: "At some point in the early 21st century, Radiohead became something more than a band: they became a touchstone for everything that is fearless and adventurous in rock, inheriting the throne from David Bowie, Pink Floyd, and the Talking Heads. The latter group gave the band its name -- it's an album track on 1986's True Stories -- but Radiohead never sounded much like the Heads, nor did they take much from Bowie apart from their willingness to experiment. Instead, they spliced Floyd's spaciness with U2's messianic arena-rock heft, bridging the gap with guitar skronk borrowed from the '80s American underground. Jonny Greenwood's jagged, brutal interjections on 'Creep,' the band's 1993 breakthrough hit, recalled the ugly noise of the Pixies and Nirvana, a sound that translated over the expanse of an ocean, but in the throes of the alternative rock explosion of the mid-'90s, Radiohead were the odd band out. America remained besotted with their homegrown sensations, so 'Creep' was treated as a one-hit wonder, and at home in England, they were seen as dour art-rock students lacking the glamour of neo-glam sensations Suede, and deliberately dodging the beery singalongs of Oasis. During the peak of Brit-pop in 1995, Radiohead released The Bends, a significant leap forward from their 1993 debut, Pablo Honey, and while that gained them some traction, it was 1997's OK Computer that broke down all the doors for the band and changed alternative rock in the process. Expanding their sound with electronica and unapologetic prog rock suites, Radiohead turned into a different band with OK Computer and the world followed suit. Soon, whenever rock bands dabbled in electronics, it was derived not from tightly sequenced rhythms, but rather, from glassy textures and introspection, a sensibility pioneered by the quintet. Radiohead doubled down on this aesthetic on 2000's Kid A, a record that traded concise hooks for minimal arrangements and jazz, providing a dividing line between an audience that once loved the group for their guitars and those listeners attracted to the band's aspirations. From this point on, Radiohead would occasionally flirt with concise song structures but were drawn toward unusual paths in both their music and business. Once their contract with EMI expired, they remained an independent band, pioneering different avenues of digital releases. They issued 2007's In Rainbows with little warning, letting listeners pay whatever they'd like for the record -- cementing Radiohead's reputation as a band compelled to look forward, not back. Every member of Radiohead were pupils at Oxfordshire's Abingdon School. Ed O'Brien (guitar) and Phil Selway (drums) were the eldest, followed by a year by Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano) and Colin Greenwood (bass). These four musicians began playing in 1985, dubbing themselves On a Friday, and before long they added Colin's younger brother Jonny, who'd previously played in Illiterate Hands with Yorke's brother Andy and Nigel Powell. Jonny started on keyboards but moved to guitar, yet this incarnation proved short-lived. By 1987, everyone but Jonny left for university, where many members pursued music, but it wasn't until 1991 that the quintet regrouped and started gigging regularly in Oxford. Eventually, they came to the attention of Chris Hufford -- then best-known as the producer of shoegaze stars Slowdive -- who offered the group the chance to record a demo along with his partner Bryce Edge; the two soon became the band's managers. EMI bit at the group's demo, signing them in 1991 and suggesting they change their name. On a Friday became Radiohead and they recorded their debut EP, Drill, with Hufford and Edge, releasing the record in May 1992. Next, the group entered the studio with producers Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade to record their full-length debut. The first fruit from these sessions was 'Creep,' a single released in the U.K. in September of 1992. 'Creep' didn't go anywhere at first. The British music weeklies slagged it, radio didn't play it, and it limped to number 78 on the charts. Pablo Honey, the band's full-length debut, appeared in February 1993, supported by the single 'Anyone Can Play Guitar,' but neither release gained much traction in their native U.K. and that May's non-LP single, 'Pop Is Dead,' didn't help matters much, either. By that point, however, 'Creep' started to gain attention in other territories. First, the song became a hit in Israel, but the bigger waves came from the United States, which was in the throes of the alternative rock revolution. Influential San Francisco radio station KITS added 'Creep' to their playlist and it spread along the west coast and onto MTV as it became a genuine hit, nearly topping Billboard's Modern Rock chart and reaching 34 on the Hot 100, a big achievement for a British guitar band. A re-released 'Creep' turned into a British Top Ten hit, peaking at number seven in the autumn of 1993. The band who'd had no success suddenly had more than it could handle. Radiohead kept touring Pablo Honey into 1994, but no subsequent hits were forthcoming, raising the spectre of the band as a possible one-hit wonder -- a criticism that weighed heavily on the group, who were anxious to record their new songs. They received the opportunity early in 1994, entering the studio to work with producer John Leckie -- then best-known for his work with the Stone Roses -- with My Iron Lung, an EP released in late 1994, being the first music released from the sessions. Muscular and ambitious, the EP provided a good indication of what would come on 1995's The Bends. Released in March 1995, The Bends not only found Radiohead growing musically -- it was dense and expansive, without skimping on songs -- but also in reputation, as critics in the U.K. embraced the band with the audience eventually following: none of the first three singles ('High and Dry,' 'Fake Plastic Trees,' 'Just') rose above 17 on the U.K. charts but the final single, 'Street Spirit (Fade Out),' wound up reaching five in early 1996. Radiohead's rise may have been assisted by the mania cultivated by Brit-pop, a term that didn't quite suit the band -- they were far artier and rock-oriented -- but nevertheless stoked interest in indie guitar bands, which the quintet certainly was. Over in U.S., The Bends stalled out at 88 on the Billboard charts but the record gained a cult following among listeners and the band never stopped touring, taking North American opening slots for R.E.M. in 1995 and Alanis Morissette in 1996. During 1995 and 1996, the group recorded new material with Nigel Godrich -- an engineer on The Bends sessions who was now the band's producer -- with songs slowly creeping out during the course of the year. 'Lucky' showed up on War Child's 1995 charity LP The Help Album, 'Talk Show Host' appeared on a B-side, and 'Exit Music (For a Film)' showed up on the soundtrack to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo & Juliet. The latter showed up on OK Computer, the June 1997 album that proved pivotal in Radiohead's career. 'Paranoid Android,' a twitchy suite released as a single in May of that year, suggested the ambition of OK Computer -- and by reaching number three, it was the band's biggest hit to date in the U.K., placing them on the cusp of a breakthrough. A breakthrough is precisely what OK Computer turned out to be, a record that proved pivotal not just for Radiohead but for the direction of '90s rock. Greeted with enthusiastic reviews and corresponding strong sales, OK Computer closed the doors on the hedonism of Brit-pop and the dour after-effects of grunge while opening a new path to sober, adventurous art-rock where electronics co-existed with guitars. Over the next few years, the band's influence would become readily apparent, but the album made a sizable impact upon its release, too, debuting at number one in the U.K. and earning a Grammy for Best Alternative Album. Radiohead supported it with an international tour, documented in Meeting People Is Easy. By the time Meeting People Is Easy showed up in theaters, the group began work on their fourth album, once again reuniting with producer Godrich. The resulting Kid A doubled down on the experimentalism of OK Computer, embracing electronics and threading in jazz. Appearing in October in 2000, Kid A was one of the first major albums to be pirated through file-sharing services, but this bootlegging had no apparent effect on the sales of the record: it debuted at number one in the U.K. and the U.S., becoming their first American chart-topper. Once again, the album took home the prize for Best Alternative Album at the Grammys and although it didn't produce any hit singles -- indeed, no singles were released from the record -- it was certified platinum in several territories. Amnesiac, a collection of new material initiated during the Kid A sessions, appeared in June of 2001, topping the U.K. charts and reaching two in the U.S. Two singles were pulled from the album -- 'Pyramid Song' and 'Knives Out' -- a signal that the album was more commercially accessible than its predecessor. At the end of the year, the band issued I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings, and by the summer of 2002, they turned their attention to recording a new album with Godrich. The resulting Hail to the Thief appeared in June of 2003, once again debuting in the upper reaches of the international charts -- number one in the U.K. and number three in the U.S. -- and the group supported the album with live dates culminating in a headlining appearance at the 2004 Coachella Festival that coincided with the release of the B-sides and remix collection COM LAG, a record that helped close out their contract with EMI. Over the next couple of years, Radiohead entered a hiatus as individual members pursued solo projects. Yorke released the heavily electronic solo collection The Eraser in 2006, and Jonny Greenwood embarked on a side career as a composer, beginning with 2004's Bodysong and then striking a fruitful collaboration with Paul Thomas Anderson for 2007's There Will Be Blood; Greenwood would also work on Anderson's subsequent films The Master and Inherent Vice. During all this, the group tentatively chipped away at their first post-EMI album. Some unsuccessful sessions with Spike Stent led the band back to Godrich by the end of 2006, and the group completed recording in June of 2007. Still without a record label, they decided to release the album digitally through their official website, letting users pay whatever they wanted for a download of the album. This novel strategy acted as the album's own promotion -- most of the articles about the release claimed it was revolutionary -- and In Rainbows allegedly moved over a million downloads on the first day of its release in October 2007. In December, the album received a physical release in the U.K., followed by a January 2008 physical release in the U.S.; the record sold well, debuting at number one in the U.K., and it earned Grammys for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package. Radiohead toured in support of In Rainbows into 2009, during which time EMI released Radiohead: The Best Of in June of 2008. The band took time off in 2010, which allowed Yorke to form a band called Atoms for Peace with producer Godrich and Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers. During this time, drummer Phil Selway released his debut solo album, Familial. By early 2011, the group finished a new album and, like In Rainbows before it, Radiohead initially released The King of Limbs digitally through their website. The downloads appeared in February, with the physical copies appearing in March; the album reportedly shifted upwards of 400,000 digital copies upon its release. That autumn brought the release of the remix album TKOL RMX 1234567, and the band continued to tour The King of Limbs material into 2012. Once the tour wrapped up, the group took some quiet time as a new round of solo projects appeared. Atoms for Peace released Amok in February 2013 and Yorke put out Tomorrow's Modern Boxes in September 2014, just a month before Selway issued his second album, Weatherhouse. In the autumn of 2014, the band began work on a new album and they continued to record throughout 2015, releasing only 'Spectre' -- a proposed James Bond theme rejected by the filmmakers -- that year. The ninth Radiohead album, A Moon Shaped Pool, appeared on May 8, 2016, preceded earlier in the week by the singles 'Burn the Witch' and 'Daydreaming.' ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi"

	name: 'DIE ANTWOORD',
	image: 'assets/images/antwoord.jpeg',
	bio: "Emerging from Cape Town, South Africa, the electronic hip-hop duo Die Antwoord struck Internet viral gold with their video hit 'Enter the Ninja,' but they're really conceptual artists Watkin Tudor Jones and Yo-Landi ViSSer presenting their 'inner zef.' Before assuming the roles of Ninja and Yo-landi ViSSer for die Antwoord, the two were involved with satirical projects like MaxNormal.TV -- which saw them wearing three-piece business suits and delivering motivational hip-hop -- and the Constructus Corporation: a hip-hop fantasy group based around a comic book called the Ziggurat. The idea for a more vulgar rave-rap group began in 2008, but it wasn’t until a year later that Die Antwoord -- which is Afrikaans for 'The Answer' -- began playing live. Their early stage shows were outrageous, with Yo-Landi baiting and flipping off the audience, while Ninja rapped and danced, wearing only his trademark Dark Side of the Moon boxer shorts. That same year they recorded their debut album, SOS, and introduced 'Zef,' which fused hip-hop, electro, and rave music. A year later, the videos they created for the tracks 'Zef Side' and 'Enter the Ninja' became viral hits. The latter featured Leon Botha, an experimental South African artist and one of the world’s oldest survivors of the premature aging disease progeria, who appeared as the group's DJ. 'Enter the Ninja' cracked the British Top 40, and major-label Interscope soon signed the group and released their 5 EP in July of 2010. That October, the label released a revised SOS with a world tour following. The group left Interscope the next year when the two parties couldn't come to terms on their next album's lead single. Left to their own devices, Die Antwoord chose 'Fok Julle Naaiers' to lead up to their sophomore album, released by their own Zef Recordz and distributed by the Diplo-associated imprint Downtown. The year 2012 saw the release of the non-album single 'XP€N$IV $H1T,' while the singles 'Cookie Thumper!' and 'Pitbull Terrier' landed on their 2014 album Donker Mag, which topped the Billboard Dance chart and peaked at number 37 on the Top 200. The duo returned in 2016 with Suck on This, a mixtape intended as an appetizer for their then-titled LP We Have Candy. Featuring production by Cypress Hill's DJ Muggs, God (aka DJ Hi-Tek) and the Black Goat, Suck on This included the single 'Bum Bum' and the rave-house 'Gucci Coochie' with Dita Von Teese. Later that year, they announced the release of Mount Ninji and Da Nice Time Kid, the duo's fourth full-length. ~ David Jeffries & Neil Z. Yeung, Rovi"

	name: 'MAJOR LAZER',

	bio: "A conceptual EDM act based around a fictional character, Major Lazer launched in 2008 as the digital reggae/dancehall project of Diplo, the globetrotting, taste-making DJ/producer whose previous collaborations included work for M.I.A. and Santigold. Recorded at Jamaica's Tuff Gong studios, Major Lazer's debut album, Guns Don't Kill People... Lazers Do, featured producer Switch as a member. Vocal contributions came from noted dancehall stars including Vybz Kartel, Busy Signal, Mr. Vegas, and Turbulence, as well as Santigold, Nina Sky, and rapper Amanda Blank. Much anticipation and online chatter were fueled in part by the novelty video/song 'Zumbi,' featuring the comedian Andy Milonakis, the frenetic, legitimate lead single 'Hold the Line,' and a goofy, invented back-story about a renegade Jamaican commando with prosthetic laser arms who was allegedly a Zombie War veteran and vampire-fighting C.I.A. operative (but was demonstrably a rampant Twitter user). The album was released in June of 2009 as a joint venture between Downtown Records and Diplo's Mad Decent label. Lazers Never Die, an EP with two new songs and three remixes, followed in 2010, along with Lazerproof, a collaborative mixtape with the English electropop duo La Roux.  In 2012, Snoop Dogg joined Diplo for the digital reggae single 'La La La,' released under the name Snoop Lion, while Switch announced he was leaving the project. Likewise, hype man Skerrit Bwoy left in order to pursue religion. Diplo carried on with producer Jillionaire, joining the group for Free the Universe, the group's sophomore album. The 2013 release featured Wyclef, Bruno Mars, Vybz Kartel, and Shaggy on its long guest list. Sean Paul and Pharrell Williams joined the party for the 2014 EP Apocalypse Soon, which was also the first Major Lazer release to include Walshy Fire, who had replaced Skerrit Bwoy as the group's live MC. The 2015 album Peace Is the Mission featured the massive hit 'Lean On,' plus chart-topping guests like Ariana Grande, Ellie Goulding, and 2 Chainz. It was also supported by an animated series that aired on the FXX cable television network. An extended edition of Peace Is the Mission appeared in November of 2015, sporting five bonus songs. In 2016, Major Lazer scored their biggest pop hit yet with 'Cold Water' (featuring Justin Bieber and MØ), which topped the charts in over a dozen countries. ~ K. Ross Hoffman, Rovi"

	bio: "Mixing bud smokers' anthems with socially conscious numbers, rapper ScHoolboy Q spent three years in the mixtape underground before launching his career properly in 2011. The first mixtape, the autobiographical Schoolboy Turned Hustla, landed in 2008 and quickly caught the attention of Kendrick Lamar and Top Dawg Entertainment. Lamar would form the Black Hippy collective with ScHoolboy along with Jay Rock and Ab-Soul, and the Top Dawg label would sign the artist. His Gangster & Soul mixtape landed in 2009, and Top Dawg released his official debut, Setbacks, in 2011. In 2012, Top Dawg announced they had signed a joint venture deal with Interscope and Aftermath, which saw Lamar's debut album get a full release. Later that year, ScHoolboy Q announced he was recording his third album and would be the second member of Black Hippy to benefit from the deal. After a series of mysterious tweets in 2013, Q announced that the release would be called Oxymoron, but nearly a year passed before the dark and abstract album -- which featured a whole host of guest producers and vocalists -- was released in February 2014. Nevertheless, it debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and pushed the single 'Studio' into the Top 40. A worldwide tour took up most of 2015, and 2016 saw the 'That Part' single drop as a preview of that year's album, Blank Face LP, which debuted at number two. ~ David Jeffries & Rich Wilson, Rovi"

	bio: "LCD Soundsystem debuted with 'Losing My Edge,' a single that became one of the most talked-about indie releases of 2002. A self-effacing spoof of the outrageous pissing contests that often occur whenever music geeks cross paths ('I was there at the first Can show in Cologne,' etc.) laid over a puttering electronic beat with the occasional bursts of discoid clatter, the track was also one of the first released on the DFA label. Several magazines and newspapers would eventually declare James Murphy, the man behind both LCD Soundsystem and DFA, to be one of the coolest people on the planet. Years of obscurity and the occasional poor decision preceded this. Just before Murphy began to cut his teeth throughout the '90s, first as a member of Pony (an average post-hardcore band with heavy debts to its inspirations) and then with Speedking (a much stronger, more unique band), he passed up the opportunity to write for the popular sitcom Seinfeld. All the time spent toiling in indie rock took a toll on Murphy, but he built his own studio and became increasingly adept at engineering and producing other bands. While working on David Holmes' Bow Down to the Exit Sign, he struck up a relationship with programmer/producer Tim Goldsworthy that developed into a partnership. By the end of 2002, there were several releases on Murphy and Goldsworthy's DFA label, most of which involved the duo in some capacity. LCD's 'Losing My Edge,' backed with an excellent neo-post-punk dance track called 'Beat Connection,' was one of them. Murphy eventually scattered three other LCD singles through the end of 2004 and released the full-length LCD Soundsystem in January 2005. At the time of its release, the DFA label was more popular than ever; Murphy and Goldsworthy had remixes for Metro Area, N.E.R.D., Le Tigre, and Junior Senior behind them, as well as failed sessions with Britney Spears that might have benefited from an interpreter. Janet Jackson was another unlikely admirer seeking the duo's assistance, but Murphy didn't bother to follow up on her request. Murphy did respond to Nike, who commissioned him to record a lengthy piece of music as part of a promotion. 45:33, released in October 2006, was aimed at joggers, but Murphy later confessed that he didn't jog himself -- mixed martial arts were more his thing, he claimed -- and was driven by the opportunity to make something in the vein of Manuel Göttsching's early-'80s electronic landmark E2-E4. (DFA would later issue 45:33 on CD, breaking the track into six parts and adding three additional cuts.) The second proper LCD Soundsystem album, Sound of Silver, was released in March 2007. It contained Murphy's most affecting songwriting and peaked within the Top 50 of the Billboard 200. Led by the single 'Drunk Girls' and an accompanying Spike Jonze-directed video, LCD Soundsystem's third studio album, This Is Happening, was released three years later. Riding high on the acclaim the album garnered, the band toured the world with fellow dance-pop group Hot Chip for much of 2010. While in London on June 29th of that year, the group recorded a full-band session at Miloco Studio. The freewheeling recording of the show was released by DFA as London Sessions in January of 2011. Right around this time Murphy announced that he was retiring the LCD Soundsystem name. The band played a farewell show at a sold-out Madison Square Garden in New York on April 2, 2011, and released the set the following year as The Long Goodbye: LCD Soundsystem Live at Madison Square Garden. In the years following, Murphy kept very busy with a variety of projects. He produced Arcade Fire's Reflektor, remixed a David Bowie track, designed special 11-foot tall speakers for DJs, created his own brand of coffee, opened a wine bar, and did the score for Noah Baumbach's film When We Were Young. In late 2015, rumors began circulating that LCD was re-forming, but these were quickly shot down by the band's label DFA. These denials proved to be a smoke screen and the group issued a new single, 'Christmas Will Break Your Heart,' before the year's end. Soon after, they announced plans to headline Coachella, play a series of live dates, and release a new album in 2016. ~ Andy Kellman & Tim Sendra, Rovi"

	bio: "Brother-and-sister duo Wild Belle make folk-, dance-, reggae-, and psychedelic rock-tinged indie pop. Chicago-area natives Elliot and Natalie Bergman grew up playing music, with Elliot eventually studying jazz saxophone at the University of Michigan. The siblings first started playing together in 2006, when Elliot invited Natalie to tour as a backup singer/percussionist with his Afro-pop band NOMO. In 2011, they began working on Natalie's songs and Wild Belle was born. A year later, the duo released the single 'Keep You' and drew label interest after a high-profile show at Austin's South by Southwest Festival. In 2013, Wild Belle released their debut album, Isles, on Columbia. Two years later, the duo returned to studios in their native Chicago, as well as in Natalie's new home, Los Angeles, to record their sophomore release. Inspired in part by personal turmoil, the album saw the pair deliver a deeper, fuller-sounding album. The resulting Dreamland was released in April 2016. ~ Matt Collar, Rovi"

	name: 'LL COOL J',
	image: 'assets/images/coolj.jpeg',
	bio: "Hip-hop is notorious for short-lived careers, but LL Cool J is the inevitable exception that proves the rule. Releasing his first hit, 'I Can't Live Without My Radio,' in 1985 when he was just 17 years old, LL initially was a hard-hitting, streetwise b-boy with spare beats and ballistic rhymes. He quickly developed an alternate style, a romantic -- and occasionally sappy -- lover's rap epitomized by his mainstream breakthrough single, 'I Need Love.' LL's first two albums, Radio and Bigger and Deffer, made him a star, but he strived for pop stardom a little too much on 1989's Walking with a Panther. By 1990, his audience had declined somewhat, since his ballads and party raps were the opposite of the chaotic, edgy political hip-hop of Public Enemy or the gangsta rap of N.W.A, but he shot back to the top of the charts with Mama Said Knock You Out, which established him as one of hip-hop's genuine superstars. By the mid-'90s, he had starred in his own television sitcom, In the House, appeared in several films, and had racked up two of his biggest singles with 'Hey Lover' and 'Doin' It.' In short, he had proven that rappers could have long-term careers. Of course, that didn't seem likely when he came storming out of Queens, New York, when he was 16 years old. LL Cool J (born James Todd Smith; his stage name is an acronym for 'Ladies Love Cool James') had already been rapping since the age of nine. Two years later, his grandfather -- he had been living with his grandparents since his parents divorced when he was four -- gave him a DJ system and he began making tapes at home. Eventually, he sent these demo tapes to record companies, attracting the interest of Def Jam, a fledgling label run by New York University students Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin. Def Jam signed LL and released his debut, 'I Need a Beat,' as their first single in 1984. The record sold over 100,000 copies, establishing both the label and the rapper. LL dropped out of high school and recorded his debut album, Radio. Released in 1985, Radio was a major hit and it earned considerable praise for how it shaped raps into recognizable pop-song structures. On the strength of 'I Can't Live Without My Radio' and 'Rock the Bells,' the album went platinum in 1986. The following year, his second album, Bigger and Deffer, shot to number three due to the ballad 'I Need Love,' which became one of the first pop-rap crossover hits. LL's knack for making hip-hop as accessible as pop was one of his greatest talents, yet it was also a weakness, since it opened him up to accusations of being a sellout. Taken from the Less Than Zero soundtrack, 1988's 'Goin' Back to Cali' walked the line with ease, but 1989's Walking with a Panther was not greeted warmly by most hip-hop fans. Although it was a Top Ten hit and spawned the gold single 'I'm That Type of Guy,' the album was perceived as a pop sell-out effort, and on a supporting concert at the Apollo, he was booed. LL didn't take the criticism lying down -- he struck back with 1990's Mama Said Knock You Out, the hardest record he ever made. LL supported the album with a legendary, live acoustic performance on MTV Unplugged, and on the strength of the Top Ten R&B singles 'The Boomin' System' and 'Around the Way Girl' (number nine, pop) as well as the hit title track, Mama Said Knock You Out became his biggest-selling album, establishing him as a pop star in addition to a rap superstar. He soon landed roles in the films The Hard Way (1991) and Toys (1992), and he also performed at Bill Clinton's presidential inauguration in 1993. Mama Said Knock You Out kept him so busy that he didn't deliver the follow-up, 14 Shots to the Dome, until the spring of 1993. Boasting a harder gangsta rap edge, 14 Shots initially sold well, debuting in the Top Ten, but it was an unfocused effort that generated no significant hit singles. Consequently, it stalled at gold status and hurt his reputation considerably.  Following the failure of 14 Shots to the Dome, LL began starring in the NBC sitcom In the House. He returned to recording in 1995, releasing Mr. Smith toward the end of the year. Unexpectedly, Mr. Smith became a huge hit, going double platinum and launching two of his biggest hits, with the Boyz II Men duet 'Hey Lover' and 'Doin' It.' At the end of 1996, he released the greatest-hits album All World, while Phenomenon appeared one year later. G.O.A.T. (Greatest Of All Time), released in 2000, reached the top of the album charts, and 2002's 10 featured one of his biggest hits in years, 'Luv U Better.' With the help of producer Timbaland, he unleashed the tough DEFinition album in 2004 as his James Todd Smith clothing line was hitting the malls. 'Control Myself,' a hit single featuring Jennifer Lopez, prefaced 2006's Todd Smith album. His 2008 effort Exit 13 would be his last album for Def Jam as the rapper found work as a primetime television star, landing a starring role on CBS'NCIS: Los Angeles. In 2013 he returned to recording, first making news with the track 'Accidental Racist,' his much-maligned duet with country star Brad Paisley. Another Paisley duet landed on LL's 2013 album Authentic, a star-studded effort with Eddie Van Halen, Snoop Dogg, and Charlie Wilson also appearing as guests. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi"

	name: 'KYGO',

	bio: "Kygo (born Kyrre Gørvell-Dahll in Bergen, Norway) broke through with a sound, termed tropical house, that tended to be brighter and more relaxed than that of his commercial dance music contemporaries. In 2013, the Avicii-inspired producer and DJ reached number one on Norway's VG-lista chart with his slow-galloping remix of Seinabo Sey's 'Younger.' He gained additional attention through remixes of Marvin Gaye's 'Sexual Healing' and Ed Sheeran's 'I See Fire.' Signed to an international deal with Sony that placed him on RCA in the U.S. and on Syco in the U.K., he released his first proper single, 'Firestone,' in 2014. Featuring a lead vocal from Conrad Sewell, the song not only went to number one in Norway but reached the Top Ten in several other territories. The following year, the Parson James collaboration 'Stole the Show' was Kygo's second consecutive solo number one hit in Norway. Later that year, 'Nothing Left,' featuring Will Heard, became his third Norwegian chart-topper. These hits, along with additional singles that featured Labrinth, Kodaline, and James Vincent McMorrow, preceded the debut full-length LP Cloud Nine, which was released in May 2016 and quickly went to number one in Norway. That month, two tracks he produced with Stargate appeared on Fifth Harmony's 7/27. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi"
